# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

In this project I made my first website as tutorial and test for starting my first steps in to learning nd preparing for the Font-end web development bootcamp
This study guide project was built to warm up my skills in web-development , and also to be able to refer to important pointers about using HTML, Git, CSS, and Javascript for me and future bootcamp students to use.
Theough this project I learned how to use the basics of Github, and inteact with with the diffeerent elements needed for a website. The code is also set to public so future bootcamp students, or Github users can read it too.

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
